# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict survival on the Titanic based on passenger features such as class and sex. The goal is to assess the model's ability to classify whether a passenger survived or not, using historical data from the Titanic disaster.

## Description
The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses logistic regression to classify passenger survival outcomes. Data is sourced from a CSV file containing information on passengers, including their class (Pclass), sex (Sex), and survival status (Survived). Key steps include data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The model is trained using features like passenger class and sex to predict survival, and its performance is evaluated through metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration:** Includes statistical summaries, value counts, and visualizations to understand data distribution and characteristics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Converts categorical variables (e.g., sex) into numerical format for model training.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes logistic regression to build a predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Predictive Capabilities:** Provides predictions on survival for new input data.

    ## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```
   git clone (https://github.com/Adithi13/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.git)
  ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```
      cd Fake-News-Classification
    ```

## Results
AThe logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 78.77%, indicating it correctly predicted survival in 78.77% of test cases. The confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed insights into the modelâ€™s performance.
